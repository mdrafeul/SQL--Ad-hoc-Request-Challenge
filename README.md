# SQL--Ad-hoc-Request-Challenge
All the ad-hoc requested queries are executed using SQL, and Power BI is used only for visualization. You can view 'CodeBasics SQL Challenge.pptx' to check the findings. Here, I have discussed the object of this project and approach I used to obtain the requested queires. 
Additionally you can check the queriy file to see the SQL codes. 
Thanks for visiting the repository. 

## Objective
- Enhance SQL skills with real-world SQL challenges.
- Sharpen analytical and problem-solving thinking.
- Gain exposure to diverse data scenarios, querying proficiency, and query optimization techniques.
- Improve the visualization of data and analyze the results for reporting purposes.


## Apporach to Challenge
- Throughly went through the dataset and asked queries, created "View" to help thoughout the quires.
- Used SQL Join, Common Table Expression (CTE) and Window Function (e.g. Rank()).
- Power BI used for visulization.
